### Design process (20/20)
  * Looks good! Remember that your wireframes should try to be accurate, so that you can use them as blueprints when you implement actual sites from them.

### Completeness (20/20)
  * -5, There is no way to edit the profile page.

### Basic HTML/CSS (20/20)
  * We recommend validating your HTML pages with the [w3c validator tool](http://validator.w3.org/) to ensure that your markup is correctly formatted. For example, the validator found a `ul` nested inside a `span`, which is not allowed (as a `span` is an in-line element).

### Version control - Git (10/10)
  * -5, Commits should represent incremental changes. For example, you committed all of your static pages at once, when you should be committing after each small change you made (at the very least, between pages)

### Additional feedback
  * Clean up the homework directory; all css files should be placed in css/, all images should be in another folder, etc.
  * Your `<title>` tags for each page should contain a short textual description of what page the user is actually on.

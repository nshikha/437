### Routing and configuration (20/20)

### Calculator functionality (13/20)

  * -2, Your calculator crashes on division by zero, the application should not crash as a result of any client provided information.

  * -5, Your calculator crashes when the hidden input fields are removed. The application should not crash as a result of any client provided information. You shouldnâ€™t assume that clients will always send input in the format that you specify. HTTP requests can be very easily forged.

### Calculator implementation (20/20)

  * -0, You might want to consider using POST requests for your calculator, to prevent the web browser from displaying your hidden data in the request URL.

### Version control - Git (0/5)

  * -5, Did not version control. ie. one commit for the entire submission.

### Additional feedback

  * Good job! Remember that any input can be forged. Trust no one!

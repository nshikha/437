### Version control - Git (10/10)

### Iterative design (5/10)
- -5, There is no view profile feature where you can view other users' profiles

### Implementation and functionality (85/85)

##### URLs and routing (urls.py) [-0]

##### Models (models.py) [-0]

##### Views (views.py) [-0]

##### Authentication [-0]

##### Templates [-0]

### Additional feedback
- It would be more intuitive if new grumbls appeared at the top of the stream rather than the bottom. You may find the [`order_by`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/models/querysets/#order-by) QuerySet method useful for this.
- You should implement a Profile model that will store additional information for users.

There is a bug for dislikes and following/block when a weird redirection is happening i think.
Otherwise all the features are implemented except for the email confirmation.

Also for some of the features, that are both on the newsfeed and profile; there is a redirection that happens; but if you go back to that page you see that the comment has been posted etc.
Eg: post a comment on someone else's profile; I think that then takes you to your own profile. But if you go back to the person's profile, the comment is there.
I didn't have time to ensure it remains on the same page because honestly in this case AJAX should be used.... will get to that next week I believe.

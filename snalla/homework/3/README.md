To turn in homework 3, create files (and subdirectories if needed) in
this directory, add and commit those files to your cloned repository,
and push your commit to your bare repository on GitHub.

Add any general notes or instructions for the TAs to this README file.
The TAs will read this file before evaluating your work.

Notes on implementation:

There is currently a “search” button for the search bar but that is temporary hence it's not placed stylistically yet.
Later on, it will be removed since the user should be able to search by keyword by pressing the return key.

Also keyword search looks for posts in which the string is a substring.
